# Covid-19-Detector
This is a online tool which is used to detect corona virus inside human body with the help of symptoms.

I have an idea or solution to global pandemic “COVID-19 VIRUS”. We all know that government is doing its best to aware people but we can’t deny the fact that it is not possible to Check and detect Virus in 133 crore Indians. But after this mobile revolution no one can deny that 99.9% people are connected through Mobile. So, I have a technology related Idea which can solve many problems which were arise due to Covid 19. There is much Confusion between people in Flu and Virus. Due to climatic change many of us are suffering from Running Nose and Sneezing Problem. And, on TV it is showing that these are the signs of COVID-19 virus. So people are being confused and running towards doctor for checkup and Those who are not infected gather in one place and give the virus a chance to attack. So, for that I have programmed and developed a website that checks 7 symptoms and if 4 and more than 4 symptoms match then it suggests to visit the doctor. Otherwise you are safe and prints the result. What makes this site unique from others is its user friendly feature. It can be easily load on any device and fast because it is programmed in Javascript which gives instant result. So there is no need of faster internet connection or a Computer. It can easily load on mobile with slower internet.  

Symptoms Check:-   

1. Cough
2. Fever
3. Age 
4. Body Pain
5. Runny Nose 
6. Difficulty in Breathing 
7.. Visited Abroad within 90 days 

If 4 and more than 4 symptoms match then it suggests to visit the doctor otherwise you are safe.
